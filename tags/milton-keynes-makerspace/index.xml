      <description>Hacky Racers! I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with Hacky Racers, a do it yourself small electric vehicle racing league in the UK since fairly early in its conception and attended the first gathering of racers. As a member of Milton Keynes Makerspace I recently wrote a small blog post about some of our involvements with Hacky Racers and what it is. The original post can be found here however I have decided to cross post it here as an archive.</description>
